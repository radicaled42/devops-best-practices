# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Phases

Software life cycle models describe the phases of the software cycle and the order in which those phases are executed. Each phase produces deliverables required by the next phase in the life cycle. Requirements are translated into design, code is produced according to the design (development phase), and after coding, testing verifies the deliverables of the implementation phase against the requirements. The testing team follows the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC), which is similar to the development cycle followed by the development team.

The six phases in every software development life cycle model are:

1. **Requirement Gathering and Analysis:** 
   - Business requirements are gathered in this phase. Project managers and stakeholders focus on this phase. Meetings with managers, stakeholders, and users determine requirements such as who will use the system, how it will be used, what data should be input, and what data should be output.
   - After gathering requirements, they are analyzed for validity and the feasibility of incorporating them into the system.
   - A Requirement Specification document is created, serving as a guideline for the next phase of the model. The testing team follows the Software Testing Life Cycle and starts the Test Planning phase after the requirements analysis is completed.

2. **Design:**
   - In this phase, the system and software design are prepared based on the requirement specifications from the first phase. System Design helps in specifying hardware and system requirements and defining overall system architecture.
   - The system design specifications serve as input for the next phase.
   - Testers develop a Test Strategy in this phase, detailing what to test and how to test.

3. **Implementation / Coding:**
   - Once the system design documents are received, work is divided into modules/units, and actual coding begins. This is the main focus for developers and is typically the longest phase of the software development life cycle.

4. **Testing:**
   - After development, the code is tested against the requirements to ensure that the product meets the needs identified during the requirements phase.
   - All types of functional testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing) and non-functional testing are performed during this phase.

5. **Deployment:**
   - After successful testing, the product is delivered or deployed to the customer for use.
   - Customers perform beta testing. If changes or bug fixes are needed, they report them to the engineering team. Once these issues are addressed, the final deployment occurs.

6. **Maintenance:**
   - After customers start using the system, actual problems may arise that need to be resolved. This ongoing support and improvement process is known as maintenance.

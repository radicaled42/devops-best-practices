# Terraform Key Concepts

In this section, we will briefly describe some key Terraform concepts. If you are already familiar with these, feel free to skip ahead.

### Terraform Configuration Language
Terraform uses its own configuration language to declare infrastructure objects and their associations. This language is declarative and describes the desired state of the infrastructure.

### Resources
Resources represent infrastructure objects and are the basic building blocks of Terraform.

### Data Sources
Data sources allow Terraform configurations to pull in external data or data from other Terraform projects.

### Modules
Modules group multiple resources and are the primary method for packaging and reusing Terraform code.

### State
Terraform maintains the state of infrastructure to track mappings to the live infrastructure, create plans, and apply changes.

### Providers
Providers are plugins that allow Terraform to interact with cloud providers and other services.

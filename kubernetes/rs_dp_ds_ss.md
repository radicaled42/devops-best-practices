# Understanding ReplicaSet vs. StatefulSet vs. DaemonSet vs. Deployments

**ReplicaSets**

A ReplicaSet helps manage traffic by scaling your application to have multiple instances of the same pod. This helps reduce traffic to one particular instance and also helps in load-balancing traffic between each of these instances.

**Deployments**

A Deployment is the preferred way to deploy an application inside a pod. It is a higher-level abstraction built on top of ReplicaSets that uses ReplicaSets internally to manage applications. In addition to the work carried out by a ReplicaSet, it provides added functionality such as:

- Rolling Updates: Rolling updates ensure that an application is updated gradually, one replica at a time, while ensuring that the overall availability of the application is not impacted. In comparison, ReplicaSets only support scaling and managing replicas.
- Rollback: Deployments automatically rollback to a previous version of an application if an update fails. For ReplicaSets, this process would need to be manually performed.
- Version Control: Similar to the previous feature, Deployments implement version control, hence allowing for the ability to rollback to a previous specific version.

Hence for such reasons, Deployments are the preferred way to go as they take care of a lot of the update and rollback functionality without any downtime and ensure that your application stays available and up to date. If you’d like to instead set up custom update functionality, then you could work with ReplicaSets.

**StatefulSet**

StatefulSet is the controller that manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Stateful pods. A stateful pod in Kubernetes is a pod that requires persistent storage and a stable network identity to maintain its state all the time, even during pod restarts or rescheduling. These pods are commonly used for stateful applications such as databases or distributed file systems as these require a stable identity and persistent storage to maintain data consistency.

**DaemonSet**

Let’s talk about our final set type: a DaemonSet. A DaemonSet ensures that a single instance of a pod is running on each node in a cluster. While the earlier controller types ensure that a specific number of replicas are running across the cluster, DaemonSets are intended to run exactly one pod per node. This is particularly useful for running pods as system daemons or background processes that need to run on every node in the cluster. Due to this, DeamonSets can be used for collecting logs, monitoring system performance, and managing network traffic across the entire cluster.

# What is Observability?

Observability is the ability to measure the internal state of a system by examining its outputs. It helps you understand what is happening, why it’s happening, and how it’s happening within your application infrastructure.

1. Metrics:
- Tells us what is happening in the system.
- Tracks performance indicators like CPU usage, memory, and request rates.
- Supports monitoring for system health and performance.

2. Logs:
- Explains why something occurred.
- Captures detailed records of system events and errors.
- Helps with logging and debugging.

3. Traces:
- Shows how things are happening.
- Tracks the flow of requests across services in distributed systems.
- Crucial for tracing the journey of a transaction or request.

Metrics = Monitoring | Logs = Logging | Traces = Tracing
